You can use this sidebar to filter and sort the data based on the columns available in the `tips` table. Here are some examples of the kinds of questions you can ask me:

1. Filtering: <span class="suggestion">Show only Male smokers who had Dinner on Saturday.</span>
2. Sorting: <span class="suggestion">Show all data sorted by total_bill in descending order.</span>
3. Answer questions about the data: <span class="suggestion">How do tip sizes compare between lunch and dinner?</span>

You can also say <span class="suggestion">Reset</span> to clear the current filter/sort, or <span class="suggestion">Help</span> for more usage tips.
